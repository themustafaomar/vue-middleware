# Introduction

Vue middleware is a powerful Vuejs plugin for creating custom middleware, similar to what you find in Nuxt apps but with extra features for roles and permissions.

It helps you manage who can access which parts of your app especially when it comes to different route-based roles or permissions using a nice driver-approach making it great with integrating other backend frameworks, for more information please visit the offical [documentation](https://vue-middleware-docs.vercel.app).

For live demo please visit [https://vue-middleware-demo.vercel.app](https://vue-middleware-demo.vercel.app).

For demo source code please visit [our playground](https://github.com/themustafaomar/vue-middleware/tree/main/packages/playground).

Out of the box it makes it super easy to handle Laravel roles and permissions without needing to set up a bunch of stuff using zero-config driver.
